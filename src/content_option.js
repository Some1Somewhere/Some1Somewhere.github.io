I weirdly like having problems, because they constantly are an inspiration to build better solutions. Technology has made life so much easier, so I learn as many different skills as possible to contribute to this ease, picking up on new ones very quickly. I have worked on multiple projects in the past either independantly, or through my startup (Pyramid Developers), which aims to provide a platform for students to learn and build projects. I am also a Teaching Assistant at NYU for the course 'DevOps and Agile Methodologies' by John Rofrano.",
